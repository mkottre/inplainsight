InPlainSight
============

InPlainSight is a theoretical project that I'm working that hides your information in plain sight. There are many efforts in protecting your information from unwanted access, but they don't stand a chance against government agencies and large businesses with budgets in the hundreds of millions of dollars. InPlainSight works by making connections to random websites at random times so that any third party recording and analyzing your browsing data will be unable to separate the sites you visited from the random data. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO GUARANTEE THAT THIS WILL IN ANY WAY PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION. THIS IS ENTIRELY A THEORETICAL PROJECT THAT I'M WORKING ON.

In order to run InPlainSight:

	python inplainsight.py

You may need to run python3 depending on your operating system.

InPlainSight only connects to web pages listed in the urls file. The default urls file currently serves as a template more than anything else. It is highly recommended to fill the file with sites that you do visit and that you don't to further obscure your data.
